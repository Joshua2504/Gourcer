# Gourcer (for gource)

Gourcer is a simple script that generates a gource video of all your repositories.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository in the same folder as your other repositories, e.g. ``Projects`` or whatever.
2. Make Gourcer executable: ``chmod +x gourcer.sh``
3. Run Gourcer: ``./gourcer.sh``

Gourcer will output a gource video including all repositories in the same folder.
